public class Elections {

//	Here is the description for Elections example.
//	Create three classes: Elections, Republican, Democratic
//	Republican has some variables: voterName, nominee, totalVotes, 
//	totalContributions
//	Democratic has some variables: voterName, nominee, totalVotes,
//	totalContributions
//	Both classes have a method called vote and a method called 
//	contribute which takes the amount as parameter.
//	In the Elections class you create voters from each party, 
//	you set the voter name, and then you make him vote. 
//	In the vote method, you print: voterName voted for nominee 
//	and also you increase the totalVotes. Some of the voters may want 
//	to contribute for their party. They call the method contribute and 
//	specify the amount of money they want to contribute. It will be added
//	to the amount of totalContributions.
//	At the end you should print the number of votes for each party and
//	check who has more votes is the winner.
//	Note: Nominee is the president candidate for each party.
